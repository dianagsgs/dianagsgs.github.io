  <h1>Diana's Site</h1>
  <p>
    Hello, my name is Diana and this is my online Curriculim Vitae.
  </p>
  <p>
    Why is it just plain HTML and links?
  </p>
  <p>
    Perhaps I aspire to be like one of those <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/18b5ju7/comment/kc2o0uj/">great minds</a>
    of computer science who simply pour all of their history in a site like this.
    Or perhaps I had a prettier React.js site but got tired of it and haven't had time to
    revamp... We will never know.
  </p>
  <p>
    Regardless, for now I need a place to house relevant documents and showcase my curriculim in chronological order, so here we are.
  </p>
  <p>
    Enjoy!

  <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a computer scientist (M.S.) with 7+ years of experience in technical, customer-facing roles.
    I excel at quickly becoming a subject matter expert and translating complex technical concepts for
    diverse audiences. I’m passionate about championing customer empathy and leveraging technology
    to drive meaningful business outcomes. I specialize in cloud technologies, and can confidently
    program in JavaScipt and Python. I am also proficient in SQL and HTML. I have completed some projects
    using React.js and PostgreSQL. I speak Spanish and English natively, and can do some conversational
    French as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my spare time, I love to ride my bicycle, eat delicious food, climb indoors, go to the movies, and
    take care of my plants.
