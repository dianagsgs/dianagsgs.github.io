    Hello, my name is Diana and this is my online Curriculim Vitae.
    Why is it just plain HTML and links?
    Perhaps I aspire to be like one of those <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/18b5ju7/comment/kc2o0uj/">great minds</a>
    of computer science who simply pour all of their history in a site like this.
    Perhaps I had a prettier React.js site but got tired of it and haven't had time to
    revamp... We will never know.
  </p>

    Regardless, for now I need a place to house relevant documents and showcase my curriculim, so here we are.     
    Thank you for visiting! And enjoy!
