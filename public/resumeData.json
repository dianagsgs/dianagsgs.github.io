    "bio":"I was born and raised in Mexico City, where I am currently located. My favorite things to do are solving puzzles, discovering new music, learning new skills, taking care of my plants, riding my bike, spending time with my loved ones, and traveling. Throughout my career, I have lived in Mexico City, California Bay Area, and Guanajuato, and obtained several degrees and certifications, including the I.B. diploma from La Escuela de Lancaster; a B.S. in Computer Science (and a minor in Math) from the University of California, Santa Cruz; a certification in Deep Learning from CIMAT; and a Masters in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I also have 5+ years of experience in technical, customer-facing roles including Instructor and Tutor for all levels of Math and Computer Science students, as well as Technical Support in Sojern and in Google Cloud. I am currently a Technical Account Manager at Qualtrics. I also volunteer as the Lead Web Developer and Site Admin for La Bestia Music Inc.",
